/*
    Approach:
    DFS from Boundary: First, the algorithm identifies all 'O' cells that are connected to the boundary of the board
    by starting DFS from each 'O' on the edges. These are temporarily marked as 'B' (boundary) to prevent them from
    being converted to 'X'.

    Conversion: After the DFS traversal, all the remaining 'O' cells, which are surrounded by 'X', are converted to 'X'.
    The 'B' cells (which represent 'O's connected to the boundary) are reverted back to 'O'.
