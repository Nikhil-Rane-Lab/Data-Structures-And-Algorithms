/*
The time complexity of the algorithm can be analyzed as follows:

- Height Calculation: The `leftHeight` and `rightHeight` functions each traverse the height of the tree,
 which is O(log n) for a complete binary tree where n is the number of nodes.

- Recursive Counting: In the worst case, the algorithm will recursively visit all nodes of the tree.
 Each recursive call does a constant amount of work outside of height calculation (checking if the tree is perfect and subtracting 1 or adding 1). Therefore, the time complexity of the recursive part is O(log n)

- Overall Time Complexity: Combining these, the overall time complexity is O(log n * log n) = O ((log n) ^2).
 This is because at each level of recursion, we perform operations that are logarithmic in complexity, and we recurse logarithmically in the height of the tree.

### Space Complexity (SC):

The space complexity primarily accounts for the space used by the recursive calls and the space used by the function call stack:

- Recursive Stack: In the worst case, the recursion depth can be (O(log n)), corresponding to a balanced tree, where ( n ) is the number of nodes.

- Auxiliary Space: Apart from the stack space, the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables and method calls,
 making the auxiliary space complexity O(1).

Therefore, the space complexity of the algorithm is O(log n).
