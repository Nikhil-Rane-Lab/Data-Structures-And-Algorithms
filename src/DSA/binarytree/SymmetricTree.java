     * Time Complexity:
     * Recursive Approach:
     * For the recursive approach, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
     * Explanation:
     * Space Complexity:
     * Recursive Approach:
     * The space complexity of the recursive approach is O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
     * Explanation:
     * The space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion stack.
     * In the worst case, the height h can be equal to n (for a completely unbalanced tree).
     * In the best case (for a balanced tree), the height h is O(logn).
     * Thus, the space complexity is O(h), which can range from O(logn) to O(n).
     * Iterative Approach:
     * The space complexity of the iterative approach is O(n)), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
     * Explanation:
     * The space complexity is determined by the maximum number of nodes in the queue at any point in time.
     * In the worst case (for a perfectly balanced tree), the queue can contain up to n/2 nodes at the last level.
     * For a skewed tree, the queue can contain O(n) nodes.
     * Thus, the space complexity is O(n) in the worst case.
     * Summary:
     * Time Complexity (TC): O(n) for both recursive and iterative approaches, where nnn is the number of nodes in the tree.
     * Space Complexity (SC):
     * Recursive approach: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (can range from O(logn).
     * Iterative approach: O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
