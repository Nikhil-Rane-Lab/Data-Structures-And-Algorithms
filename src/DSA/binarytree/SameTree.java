    //TC: O(n) The function traverses each node in both trees exactly once
    //SC: O(h) where h is the height of the tree.
    //The space complexity is determined by the recursion stack.
    //  1) In the worst case, the height of the tree can be equal to the number of nodes in the tree,
    //     which happens when the tree is skewed (all nodes are on one side).
    //  2) For a balanced tree, the height h is O(logn).
    //So, the space complexity is O(h), where â„Ž h can range from O(logn) (for a balanced tree) to O(n) (for a skewed tree).
